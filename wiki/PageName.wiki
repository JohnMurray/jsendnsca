==About JSend NSCA==

JSend NSCA is an API for sending Nagios Passive Checks to the [http://www.nagios.org/ Nagios] [http://www.nagios.org/faqs/index.php?section_id=5&expand=false&showdesc=true NSCA] add-on. 

The current solution for sending Passive Checks is to use Runtime().exec(..) and call the send_nsca tool. Not only is this not cross-platform as send_nsca runs on nix platforms only but it is also slow and a bit ugly IMHO.

I'm using the basis of this code currently where work in a production environment so I guess you too can safely and reliably use this code.

Thanks goes to the [http://nagiosappender.sourceforge.net/ NagiosAppender] project which I used to work out the details of the Passive Check protocol.
